A brand that started out as a couple of DJs that became close friends and decided to put on an event that captured the glamorous side of house music and cherry picked the best bits of all the parties they had attended or DJ'd at. It became something of a phenomena in the UK and beyond attracting massive media attention, becoming the favourite  haunt of celeb's, WAGs and football players and firmly putting the now legendary Ampersand on the map.\nTwisted Elegance celebrated it's 8th Birthday at it's new monthly home in Manchester and pulled clubbers of old out of retirement to party alongside the next generation to create the perfect atmosphere and the ultimate party. I have put this mix together to capture some of the highlight tracks of my 2 hour set which was packed full of Twisted anthems old and new, together with a couple of my own cheeky bootlegs and edits that are known to bring the floor alive with smiles and cheers.\nIf you were one of the fortunate that experienced this amazing party, I hope that this captures some of your musical highlights and for those that didn't come and join us, Twisted Elegance Parties are held the 3rd Saturday of every month at Venus Manchester\nMore Twisted Classics and Anthem mixes to follow that capture the first 5 amazing years","image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/122\/images\/music_images\/1173.jpg"},"category_id":"0"},{"flags":12,"id":"1107","title":"Dave Ellis In The Mix - Twisted Elegance Live, Saturday 20th November 2010","duration":0,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/7283669\/stream?consumer_key=r7Ldd4KYA5KnzbGlbRLg","soundcloud_uri":"http:\/\/api.soundcloud.com\/tracks\/7283669\/stream","year":0,"note":"As Dave is such a busy bunny, we recorded his live set to upload for the Twisted Elegance iPhone App.\n\nDave is our warm up specialist.
