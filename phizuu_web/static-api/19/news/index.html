For the first time ever you can now get your hands on a fantastic range of Lange / Lange Recordings merchandise through our partners at Trackitdown.net and our stylish Lange Spreadshirt shop. As well as a branded range we've worked closely with some fantastic designers to create exclusive designs themed by some of your favourite tracks and we'll be expanding the range throughout the year alongside some of the hottest Lange releases!

You can check out the Lange Spreadshirt range at lange.spreadshirt.co.uk and our TID range at trackitdown.net.

To celebrate the launch we’re giving you the chance to win a £50 (or equivalent in home currency) Trackitdown voucher. Simply get yourself in an item of Lange clothing and get yourself photographed in the most exciting place you can think of! The best pics could get used for promotion on the merchandise sites. Submissions can be made to info@lange-music.com and the deadline is 29th March. Good Luck!</description><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
