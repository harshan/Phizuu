His undeniable skill as a remixer has also seen him remix tracks for massive artists like Erick Morillo, Robbie Rivera, Paul van Dyk, Roger Sanchez, Ian Carey, Antoine Clamaran, Huggy &amp; Dean and Alex Gaudino.

So it´s hardly surprising that Thomas Gold was nominated for Beatport “Best Progressive House Artists” and even won the beatport award in the category “Best Progressive House Track” for his remix on Delerium “Silence”.

With this strength and quantity of material its no wonder Thomas has gained such a massive following amongst discerning clubbers, Labels and other DJs. His tracks are hot property with Axwell, Mark Knight, Erick Morillo, TV Rock, DJ DLG, Vandalism, Alex Gaudino, Pete Tong, Norman Doray, Syke´n Sugarstarr, Antoine Clamaran, Dabruck &amp; Klein and Stonebridge all counting themselves as fans of his work.
