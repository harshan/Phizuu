Their debut release for the imprint will be 'Black Keys', released on Friday 4th April.

'Black Keys' was recorded at Marcata Studios in upstate New York; and was produced by the band and Kevin McMahon, best known for his work with The Walkmen and Titus Andronicus. The single has been mixed by John Goodmanson (Nada Surf, Fight Like Apes, Blood Brothers) in Seattle.

Formed in the mid-Noughties, Mark (guitar, vocals) and cousin Shane (the drums) recruited Tom (the bass), finding common ground on The Smiths, NYC punk rock and Thin Lizzy. The band invested in some serious vintage amplification and a classic power trio sound sound started to emerge. Cojones the size of cartwheels and the horsepower to deliver.

Channeling the primal surge of rampant garage rock 'n' roll with elements of the blues and gospel; The Minutes have honed their craft on the Irish gig circuit and beyond. Support slots along the way with Supergrass, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club and The  Phantom Band have helped introduce them to audiences bored with identikit “Howyaz Indie” and hungry for something more urgent and direct. 11 gigs in 3 days at 2010's SXSW festival cemented The Minutes reputation as gig-thirsty tour monsters with the tunes to match the swagger. 

The band return to Austin, Texas in March this year to deliver another sweat soaked, swamp rock payload. Watch out SXSW.

Already tipped for success in 2011 by State.ie and Paul McLoone (Today FM); the band sealed the deal with a beserker blast at 'Other Voices'; watch out for their show-stealing performance on RTE 2 on March 3rd.

The Minutes are special guests of the hotly fancied Mona at Whelan's in February 17th. More Irish shows are in the pipeline.

'Black Keys' is released on download single on Model Citizen Records on Friday 4th April. The debut album 'Marcata' will follow in May.</description><pubDate>Fri, 28 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>SXSW 2011 confirmed</title><link></link><description>The Minutes will return to SXSW this March for another assault on the Austin crowds.
