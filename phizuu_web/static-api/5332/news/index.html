We are happy to welcome Martin Patino who has already had releases on the labels ‘’Flash’’ and '’Be as one’'. He brings us a fresh Deep and Tech House release filled with harmonic and drifty beats. Mirror Groove takes you on a journey through honest and clear beats which you can‘t avoid. The release Seul, with its pumping beats will make you rock the dance floor! 
Modest like before, Colludo takes one step after another to achieve the music-heaven.
