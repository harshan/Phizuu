With PAENGA, OPEN LIGHTS, DAYS LIKE NEVER and TEORE we notice that Michael Gull\u2019s productions are always stigmatized by his precise and high quality work. No wonder, because music runs through his blood since he is a young kid. PA-PA-PAENGA is constantly spotted by funky and groovy beats which makes every party rock the house or should we better say OPEN LIGHTS. However, the dance floor will be full and nobody will go home. TEORE produced together with Eleminal concludes this charge of full explosive tones.
