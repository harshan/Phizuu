The Release Yourself™ empire is still a force to be reckoned with in it's 10th year existence, built upon a foundation of emotion, passion, and energy.  It is now the time to celebrate the decade of the â€˜old worldâ€™, and look ahead to 10 more years of the Sanchez revolution. No wonder, then, that the multi-award-winning artist from Queens, New York has chosen â€˜The Beginning Of A New Eraâ€™  as the 2010 theme celebrating the closing of an incredible decade of house music, and the beginning of a new decade filled with innovative beats and mind blowing performances. With no better place to kick off Release Yourself than Mansion in Miami during Winter Music Conference on March 24th, Roger has planned a spectacle unlike anything seen before.....

2010 is a truly memorable year for Roger as he celebrates 10 years of his famous residency in Ibiza.  This year Roger will as well release a new â€˜Release Yourselfâ€™ compilation, all on Rogerâ€™s own Stealth label.  For 10 years Roger Sanchez has dictated the tempo of the house music scene, bringing audiences up and coming artists that have grown to become big-time-players in the dance world. Even after 10 years Roger sees no reason to slow down as he looks forward to breaking barriers in house music for the next decade.....

Throughout Rogerâ€™s career Mansion in Miami, has proven to always be an unforgettable stop on tour- a club full of the S-Manâ€™s most dedicated fans. Adding to this audience is the buzz and excitement that Winter Music Conference has always created among the music community.  Thus to start the new Sanchez decade off with a bang, Roger is planning a live experience unlike any other.....

With Release Yourself: The Beginning Of A New Era taking a cue from the ways of the future, it can only be expected for Roger to bring a live spectacle  unlike anything experienced before. Release Yourself will take the audience out of this world into an entire futuristic experience. In the metallic room, amidst the lights, lasers, and fog the audience will look up towards Roger, only to see the S-Man himself coming towards them. Yes, this years Release Yourself will be an entire 3D experience!  3D visuals will be projected onto giant screens behind Sanchez as he takes control of the club.  With the mix of eye-popping 3D visuals and heart-pounding Sanchez beats, it can be certain that the audience will totally lose themselves in the audio-visual spectacle. Topping off the excitement of a new decade will be the debut of Rogerâ€™s hot new single â€œ2getherâ€- already receiving a tremendous amount of buzz in the dance scene.  Throughout his career, Roger Sanchez has been known as a DJ that breaks barriers, and with this yearsâ€™ Release Yourself: The Beginning Of A New Era, another barrier has been broken.....
