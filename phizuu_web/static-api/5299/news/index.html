This year's summer song contest of the ZDF morning magazine has a winner. Out of ten bands, the song &quot;Estrella de Mar&quot; of the Latin Soul singer and composer Bonny Ferrer based in Hamburg and her band &quot;Bonny Ferrer &amp; The Latin Souls&quot; were selected as winners.
The MoMa song contest is a great platform for new bands to test out the acceptance by the public.
&quot;I am pleased that I got such a great response, &quot;says Bonny Ferrer.
The original composition of the singer was released on her first CD &quot;De dentro hacia fuera&quot;. On the same CD is also the title &quot;Qué harías tu?&quot; with which she has already won the NDR 2 Newcomer of the Week Award.

The Ghanaian-Spanish musician who was raised in Ghana, Spain and Germany  was hardly surprised by her victory - right after the broadcast on ZDF music experts agreed: &quot;Estrella de Mar&quot; is the Summer Song 2010.

Bonny Ferrer &amp; The Latin Soul have already played on festival stages, such as 
&quot;Maschsee Festival&quot; and &quot;Duckstein Festival. Bonny is also a welcome artist at the Polo Players Night of the annual polo tournament taking place on manor Basthorst.

With her wam, sexy voice, she casts a spell on every listener.
Through her music, Bonny Ferrer stirs the hearts and souls of her listeners. Her unmistakeable style is reflected in each one of her songs. 
The mixture of Latin and soul, inspired by her Spanish and African roots, leaves listeners swaying to the rhythm of the music and invites them to dance. 

When the Afro-Spaniard, who grew up in Hamburg, reaches for the microphone, there’s always a hint of glamour in the air. She captures her audience with her naturalness, charm and temperament. She radiates a Latin joie de vivre mixed with a Hanseatic reserve. 

Following countless arrangements and television appearances as a background singer for well-known acts such as Kim and Oceana, Young Denay and Princessa and after featuring as one of the main voices on James Last’s “New Party Classics”, she published songs on various compilations (Brazilution, The Best of Syke ´n´ Sugarstarr, Ibiza Loungin´, Smoove Moves, Kultur spiegel and many more). 

But the Ghanaian-born singer’s real passion is her own music: Latin soul. 

Bonny Ferrer expresses her very essence on her current CD “de dentro hacía fuera”: from the inside out. 
Revealing her innermost self. Inspired by artists such as Sade and Gloria Estefan, she sings about true stories dictated by life. 

Deep and meaningful lyrics, skilfully packaged in light compositions. 

Listening is a pleasure. It is music that truly leaves its mark. The creative Piscean has almost all her instrumentalists playing live, giving the listener the feeling they are at one of her concerts.
