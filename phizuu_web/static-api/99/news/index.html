Text in books, web pages, and email is crisp at any size. Images in movies and photos are stunning at almost any angle. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s because the Retina displayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s pixel density is so high, your eye is unable to distinguish individual pixels.

Now you can run your favorite third-party apps ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â and switch between them instantly ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Â without slowing down the performance of the foreground app or draining the battery unnecessarily.* This smarter approach to multitasking is available only on iPhone.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jul 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Colombo</title><link></link><description>I am in colombo..</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
