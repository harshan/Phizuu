Last visiting in 2008 with 'Amsterdam', this new outing sends the series in the opposite direction and homes in on one of Eastern Europe's most awe-inspiring capitals...\r\n\r\nJust over a month ago, during the final stages of his set at Transmission - Future Cities, Markus Schulz held a poster up to the audience. Caught by the cameras feeding the O2 arena's video screens the image went stage to ceiling. That poster bore the front cover of 'Prague'11' and in holding it aloft Schulz had announced that the Czech capital would be the destination for his 2011 city compilation.\r\n\r\nHaving played there twice a year, every year for the last five, it's certainly a place he's developed a strong association with. His regular visits over the period have positioned him well to see the explosion in the popularity of trance and progressive -- a rise Markus gauges visit-on-visit has being \"close to exponential\"... \r\n\r\nHe continues: \"seeing music scenes expand, no matter what style they are, isn't something a DJ ever tires of. Going to and from Prague in particular, but also to other Eastern European countries -- Poland, The Ukraine for example - over the course of five years, and witnessing what's happened with the music there, has made for an incredible collective experience for me. \r\n\r\nPersonally 'Prague'11' is designed to reflect not only what's happening in the city in the hear-&-now, but also my many musical experiences in the Czech Republic at large. Underground spots like Mecca, multitier super-clubs like SaSaZu & world-class arena events like Transmission have all cumulatively played their part. The clubbing population has embraced trance & progressive music on a grand scale and this is me holding a mirror up to it.\"\r\n\r\nWith his fifth Transmission event played in early November, Schulz has spent the intervening 6 weeks on a comprehensive mission to find fresh-off-the-production-desk electronic music from around the world to create Prague's profile for the release. On the 11th of February he will unveil the mixes and the day after will return to the city with the music to play a special one-off night at the spectacular SaSazU club.","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/B08LH08OH_I\/default.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"1283","title":"Markus Schulz - Future Cities (Official Music Video) [Full HD]","duration":211,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pm3R88gZv5A&feature=youtube_gdata_player","year":0,"note":"Download on iTunes: http:\/\/bit.ly\/Markus_Future_Cities Download on Beatport: http:\/\/bit.ly\/FutureCities \r\n\r\nDownload the new Prague '11 compilation on iTunes: http:\/\/bit.ly\/Prague_Markus_Schulz \r\nGet the CD here: http:\/\/bit.ly\/Prague11CD\r\n\r\n\r\n2011 will be the year in which the Czech Republic capital Prague comes into sharp focus under the eyes of every Markus Schulz and Coldharbour follower - and for more reasons than one. His affections and admiration for the city of Prague will be represented in the 2011 edition of his compilation series. \r\nAnd in anticipation of its release, Coldharbour Recordings presents you a very special anthem; produced specifically for Prague's leading contribution to clubbing. \r\nThe annual Transmission extravaganza now stands as one of the premier dance events in the world, and the 2010 concept presented Markus with the challenge of producing a theme for the recent November night - his second such task in the space of only three years. His effort of The New World in 2008 projected him towards the trance elite, and in 2010, as one of the outstanding and consistent performers across the circuit, he took to the stage at Transmission to headline 'Future Cities'. \r\nAlready a firm fans' favorite on Global DJ Broadcast, thanks to World Tour plays in the cities of Budapest, Toronto and Bucharest, the 20,000 capacity audience at the O2 Arena channelled their emotions in unison, as Markus opened his performance on the night fittingly with the anthem. A typical driving bassline, soaring sirens and a beautiful uplifting melody embodies the passion of the Prague people, and is one anthem which will be setting many livesets alight in 2011 and beyond. Markus Schulz presents to you Future Cities. \r\n\r\nThe future is now.","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pm3R88gZv5A\/default.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"1277","title":"Markus Schulz - Rain (Official Music Video)","duration":207,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o2_7xH5FbOw&feature=youtube_gdata_player","year":2010,"note":"Download on iTunes: http:\/\/bit.ly\/CLHR105\r\nDownload on Beatport: http:\/\/bit.ly\/CLHR105BP\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the album \"Do You Dream?\"\r\nExtended versions out now, Beatport exclusive, get it here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/DoYouDreamBP\r\nDownload on iTunes: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/DoYouDreamiTunes\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the dust settled on an enthralling Summer of Schulz 2010, the winter months are coming closer, as is the time for annual reflection. And when Markus Schulz gathers this thoughts encapsulating the previous 12 months, one of the outstanding achievements will be his personal homage to one of the most thriving clubbing conglomerates found anywhere worldwide, through his annual city compilation, Las Vegas '10. \r\n\r\nThe sign of his affection started with the track 'Sin City' under his Dakota moniker in 2009, continued with the 2010 compilation in February, and now comes into sharp focus once again with the next single release from his critically acclaimed Do You Dream artist album.\r\n\r\nFound at the epicentre of Las Vegas clubbing is The Palms Casino & Resort, and inside lies a nightclub whose admiration continues to grow week by week. It is a night which now features regularly in Markus' extensive tour schedule, and the legacy of this club continues to grow alongside his own.\r\n\r\nTherefore, his next single is aptly named after the club in question, entitled, 'Rain'.\r\n\r\nThe original is now a familiar staple through Markus' monthly live World Tour expeditions on his Global DJ Broadcast radio show, featuring in cities such as Moscow, London and Budapest. The break provides a real hands-in-the-air moment for a live audience, with a melody guaranteed to hook the listener in and not let go. \r\n\r\nWith the original regarded as one of the defining pieces of his Do You Dream album, Markus was faced with the challenge of assembling remix projects to add a further dimension to Rain. And as a result, he turned to two names which can count themselves as modern-day heroes of Coldharbour. \r\n\r\nThe first is a man who needs no introduction, who kicked off 2010 with a stunning remix of Rex Mundi's Opera of Northern Ocean, and cemented his legacy even further by bringing the sacred Language by Hammer & Bennett back to life for the Coldharbour 100 celebrations. And now, Dutchman Finne Jager delivers arguably his biggest remix to date, giving Rain a serious injection of power and euphoria. Phynn's efforts were fully exploited to capacity crowds at New York's Electric Zoo Festival and Toronto's Labour of Love in September, as well as the closing weeks of the Ibiza season at Amnesia, and his remix now one of the most requested tunes in Markus' livesets today. \r\n\r\nHowever, also delivering an imagination-capturing remix is Los Angeles-based duo Michael Calderone and Austin Hall, better known to many as The Space Rockerz. They made their mark on Global DJ Broadcast earlier this year with their track \"Weather the Storm\" chalking up a multitude of plays in a few short months, and followed it up with a big remix of Skytech's \"Comet\". Their remix was debuted to the world at Markus' last appearance for Rain in Las Vegas itself, and grabbed lots of attention on the Global DJ Broadcast a few weeks later.\r\n\r\nThrough Rain, Markus Schulz rolls the dice and brings a piece of Las Vegas and showcases it to the world. And judging by the reactions of audiences both live and on radio, he has produced a winner.","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/o2_7xH5FbOw\/default.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"1281","title":"Markus Schulz feat.

For Markus Schulz, this hypothesis holds true.\r\n\r\nAt the turn of the millennium, Markus found himself living in the suburbs of London, on Brixton's Coldharbour Lane, in an attempt to discover his true inner sound. Through his long nights in the studio and attending clubbing nights across the city, such as the iconic Turnmills, he seized various elements that would contribute towards the Coldharbour sound that we love and admire today. However, one track opened his eyes like never before - Cass & Slide's iconic \"Perception\".\r\n\r\nIn any subsequent interview he has conducted over the past 10 years, Markus cites Perception as the track he wished me made himself, a testament to how much it has continued to influence him. And in the summer of 2008, Markus made his own update of the track for his livesets that year, in instrumental form.\r\n\r\nFast forward to December 2009, and four days before the historic Best of Both Worlds event in Amsterdam. Longtime friend and one of the leading vocalists across the electronic genre, Justine Suissa, teamed up with Sacha Collison - who wrote the vocals for Perception originally for Naimee Coleman in 2000. And thanks to Justine's vocals, Perception blossomed into life, and many fans of the new generation suddenly realised this track's importance to the history of dance music.\r\n\r\nGiven his blessing by old friend Peter Martin (Slide), Markus was honored to include his interpretation of Perception on his Do You Dream album. A surprise to many, but everyone across the community were delighted with this development. A staple in his Global DJ Broadcast World Tour sets, Perception remains one of the most requested tracks in Markus' playlists today.\r\n\r\nTo top it all off, Markus announced during his interview with Armin van Buuren at A State Of Trance 450 in Poland that he had recruited Finnish duo Super8 & Tab for remix duty - one of the rising stars in trance over recent years. Their result is a tough and upfront take on the original, perfect for those peaktime moments in the big arenas and festivals, already demonstrated at Amnesia in Ibiza on several occasions. \r\n\r\nPerception is best described as the signature Markus Schulz experience crammed into the space of 12 minutes. It is a track that is so special to him, and a track that is special to so many of his followers.\r\n\r\nWhen the dust settles on the Summer of Schulz 2010, many will remember it as the year the iconic Perception was brought back to life.\r\n\r\nmore info: www.armadamusic.com","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IOOgJx6MDso\/default.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"688","title":"Markus Schulz  - The New World Markus (Official Music Video)","duration":275,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zh3C97J056Q&feature=youtube_gdata","year":2010,"note":"Download here: http:\/\/clk.tradedoubler.com\/click?p=24371&a=1488904&url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.apple.com%2FWebObjects%2FMZStore.woa%2Fwa%2FviewAlbum%3Fi%3D300302466%26id%3D300302459%26s%3D143452%26partnerId%3D2003\r\n\r\nMarkus Schulz is back with a new single. The New World is the atmospheric trancer that is set to take off a new phase in Markus Schulz musical career. With the success of his Progression album and his recently acquired number 8 position in the DJ Mag Top 100 still fresh in memory, its time to shake the crowd with a new type of sound. One that fits the arenas, clubs and hallways of this world.\r\n\r\nThe New World is his stunning new trancer thatll destroy the dance floor with its trembling beat and epic melody. The New World has definite impact. And that was exactly what Markus had in mind while producing it. Markus: In November I played at my third Transmission event in Prague, Czech Republic. The organizers of the event asked me to compose a special theme for the night. When you play in the big arenas, you need a special type of track in your set to work exclusively for that type of setting. This is why The New World is slightly more techy and upfront. I get inspired seeing wave upon wave of people in these arenas, the sheer volume of the crowd can take your breath away sometimes. So you need to make something that really strikes home with everyone in the arena, whether they are right up at the front or back. But I feel that the track still has my trademark groove and melody.\r\n\r\nThe New World comes with an original mix and a slightly more progressive, darker Coldharbour remix. The New World welcomes you to Markus Schulz sound.\r\n\r\nDownload more music from Markus Schulz here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.itunes.com\/markusschulz\r\n\r\nFor more info check:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.armadamusic.com \r\nhttp:\/\/www.markusschulz.com","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Zh3C97J056Q\/2.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"1278","title":"Dakota - Koolhaus [Official Music Video]","duration":241,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=adlhdT5YnUM&feature=youtube_gdata_player","year":2010,"note":"Download at iTunes here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/36uxo5z\r\nDownload at Beatport: https:\/\/www.beatport.com\/en-US\/html\/content\/release\/detail\/194488\/Koolhaus\r\n\r\n\r\nTaken from the Dakota album \"Thoughts Become Things\"; download the album here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/3a6s429\r\nBuy the album cd here: http:\/\/tinyurl.com\/36qnvt8\r\n\r\nUnder his Dakota guise, Markus Schulz has presented a series of stories which have chronicled his incredible journey in the EDM world, accumulated through his 'Thoughts Become Things' album.\r\n\r\nIn March, Markus released the latest installment of his annual city compilation series, and this year paid tribute to home of one of the greatest nightclubs in the world in the process; the city - Toronto; and the club - Koolhaus. During the winter months,  whilst laying the groundwork for both the 'Toronto '09' compilation and the resurrection of his Dakota moniker, Markus wished to pay tribute to one of the cities that has continually inspired him by constructing a track, and titling it after a place which has given him some of his greatest memories as a DJ. The Koolhaus resides inside The Guvernment complex, and is utilized for special events throughout the year such as the annual 'Labour of Love' extravaganza held every September. Markus' appearance at the 2005 edition, broadcast live around the world on radio, stands out as one of his defining moments on the international stage. The 'Koolhaus' track therefore reflects the resonation Markus has with his Toronto fans, who have always welcomed him as one of their own.\r\n\r\nWhen the 'Thoughts Become Things' album was released in June, Koolhaus became the centre of attention at an incredible rate. The track has been a highlight of Markus' sets throughout the best part of 2009, played in cities such as New York, London, the World Tour broadcast from Melbourne, and of course his marquee appearances at Amnesia in Ibiza this summer.\r\n\r\nFor remix duties, Markus has recruited two sets of brothers who have made a serious impact on Global DJ Broadcast playlists over the past three years in their own way. First are Pavel and Vitaliy Khvaleyev, the Russian brothers known all around the world as Moonbeam. No strangers to Coldharbour Recordings Red thanks to their moody tones already applied to Lens' 'Beyond the Shadows' in 2008, they deliver a deep yet delightful interpretation on the original, and has already featured in the early stages of Markus' extended sets throughout the summer.\r\n\r\nTo complete the package, we switch attention from Russia to Poland, and to the duo who have had a breakout year thanks to their dancefloor smash on Coldharbour Recordings, Cardboard Box. Julian and Mateusz Dziewulski, presenting themselves as Skytech, offer two remixes. The first debuted to grand acclaim on Armin van Buuren's A State Of Trance in early September, and the second is primed to rock dancefloors as Amsterdam Dance Event approaches, with a special Stadium Mix on offer.\r\n\r\nDakota brings the power and spirit harnessed inside the Koolhaus, and unveils it to the world.\r\n\r\nFor more information visit:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.itunes.com\/markusschulz\r\nhttp:\/\/www.armadamusic.com","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/adlhdT5YnUM\/default.jpg"}},{"flags":12,"id":"1279","title":"Dakota - Sin City (Official Music Video)","duration":266,"stream_uri":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=haRLfudMG3Y&feature=youtube_gdata_player","year":2010,"note":"Download This Release: http:\/\/clk.tradedoubler.com\/click?p=24371&a=1488904&url=http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZStore.woa\/wa\/viewAlbum?i=326647610&id=326647537&s=143452&uo=6&partnerId=2003\r\n\r\nFor more information visit:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.itunes.com\/markusschulz\r\nhttp:\/\/www.armadamusic.com","image":{"thumb_uri":"http:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/haRLfudMG3Y\/default.jpg"}}]}
