The remix of SOULCHILD is delivered by two well‐known guys – COMPACT GREY &amp; ZER, which are also responsible for Mooose003. They approached the track in a different way, straight from the beginning using pumping bases and strong claps. For recognition they used the original vocal, cut it into pieces, and let it sound like a sexy moaning. Then – after the first break – they add a humming sub melody, which leads the remix to its peak. Goose bumps on Mooose Records!!

supported by: Laurent Garnier, Renato Cohen, Haito, Pizeta, Juliet Sikora, Paco Osuna, Brothers Incognito, DJ Linus, Glanz &amp; Ledwa, Severin Breitkopf, UGLH, Homebase, Black Vel, Ondrej, DJ Misk, and many more . . .</description><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>El Fantasticó</title><link></link><description>2011 Peaktime Boutique aka Beatamines &amp; Compact Grey are on Fire! &quot;El Fantasticó&quot; is the new track with the huge snake charmer sound and the big tech-house beats!
