&quot;Komune is dedicated to connecting adventurous, fun-loving, environmentally conscious travellers who share
a passion for surf and beach culture&quot; said Komune part owner, Tony Cannon.
&quot;Komune have carefully selected its first sites in Australia and Bali fronting world-class surf breaks and will combine exotic eco-design, great beats and a friendly, community spirited atmosphere.
Komune Gold Coast is located on Marine Parade Coolangatta next to the Greenmount surf club.
&quot;Three of Australia's premier surf breaks are within three hundred metres of our Coolangatta site. Customers will be able to walk to Kirra, Snapper and D Bah&quot; said Cannon
&quot;We will be providing a variety of stylish accommodation to suit all budgets within each location, from share
accommodation, self contained beachfront apartments through to bungalows, villas and luxury penthouses.
The aim of Komune is that everyone gets to join in the action at Komune just like out in the lineup&quot;
said Cannon
&quot;We've commissioned Italian Architect Giovanni D'Ambrosio who has worked in Bali for the last 15 years to design both the inaugural resorts. The idea using Giovanni is to design a very innovatative, but chilled beach club and resort atmosphere both in the pool bar areas and in the accommodation. Giovanni's brief was to create a place where guests and friends really want to meet and relax hence the brand, Komune. We've also had a lot of fun with Giovanni creating a whole floor rock-star penthouse suite at level 9&quot; said Cannon
Partners behind the Komune brand are keen surfers Tony Cannon, Gwinganna Resort Owner, Tony de Leede and ex World No 2 Pro Surfer, Luke Egan.
&quot;After travelling the world for many years surfing, Komune will be a breath of fresh air and we are committed to developing accommodation to a surfers specification. Stylish rooms, great areas to hang plus walking distance to A grade waves is what our brand is about&quot; said Egan</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Feb 2010 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
