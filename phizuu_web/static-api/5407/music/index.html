Featuring the vocal talents of Carol Lee 'Love is Darkness' sits firmly on the fence in between house and trance. The track has an almost rock or indie feel with Lee's hypnotising vocal and when coupled with van Doorn's masterful production and acute ear for creating stadium sounding productions then you know that you have something special indeed.

Peace was written back-to-back with Little Soul from the album and their spiritual element forms a cornerstone to SOTU. Weve had spiritual references on previous records, with this one its a little more obvious. says Martin. The track features exquisitely placed electronics and cathartic choral refrains from Dave Gahan and Martin Gore.\n\nSander commented, \"I have been a fan of Depeche Mode since I was a young so to be asked to do a remix for them is beyond a dream come true. 'Peace' is outstanding and one of my favourite tracks off the album\".\n\nSander's remix gives the best in elec-tech for the big floors and justifies his meteoric rise to fame, illustrating why he is one of the most in demand producers and DJs in the world.
