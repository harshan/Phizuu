A sextet of \u201ckids chasing pure soul with whatever tools are at hand,\u201d The Mumlers hail from San Jose, California, a city not much known for its musical output but rather its diverse population and its status as an epicenter of the cyber world. Oddly enough, the tools they use are quirky and old and the songs they create emanate from a place on the fringes of modernity, more in line with the forgotten oldies blasting from lowriders around their hometown than with the flashing, disposable universe of the internet.","cover_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_images\/247.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/247.jpg"},"flyer_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_images\/247.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/247.jpg"},"buy_urls":[{"title":"Buy on iTunes","uri":"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/dont-throw-me-away-bonus-track\/id325003778"},{"title":"Vinyl and Compact Disc","uri":"http:\/\/www.midheaven.com\/item\/dont-throw-me-away-by-mumlers-cd"}],"like_count":"0"},{"id":"248","title":"iTunes Session EP","information":"iTunes Exclusive EP","details":"New versions of two songs from the Mumlers\u2019 debut, Thickets & Stitches, and two from their follow-up album, Don\u2019t Throw Me Away, recorded in a single day in San Francisco in the fall of 2009 with the aid of vibraphones, Columbian tiple, and plate reverb.","cover_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_images\/248.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/248.jpg"},"flyer_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_images\/248.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5372\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/248.jpg"},"buy_urls":[{"title":"Buy on iTunes","uri":"http:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/album\/itunes-session-ep\/id342387306"}],"like_count":"0"},{"id":"249","title":"Thickets & Stitches","information":"First Full Length record","details":"Thickets and Stitches, the debut album from Bay Area ensemble The Mumlers, is an amalgamation of wry, witty lyrics and traditional rock instrumentation tastefully embellished by more unusual elements including swelling brass, plaintive slide guitar, frog collar & singing saws.
