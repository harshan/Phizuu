Many good things are going on around the band at the moment and of course we want to share… :)
This Thursday we went on our first trip to Finland. It’s always exciting to explore new territory and meet new people, but also a bit queasy since you never know what to expect. But Helsinki was everything we had hoped it would be!
Even though we only stayed for a single day we meet an incredible amount of good Finnish people.
First we did a short session and an interview with the good people at Radio Helsinki and next we went to the legendary venue Tavastia Klubi to sound check and later on play an awesome concert in front of an awesome crowd. GREAT NIGHT!
Friday morning started with an acoustic session with the guys from Off the Record at the Natural History Museum. We played three songs among dinosaur skeletons and stuffed animals from the African savannah. We’re very excited to see the result which will be posted here.
Last stop in Finland was the good people at national radio station YLEX. Thorben and Kristine did an interview about whiskey as a cure for jet lag, good Finnish pronunciation and one night stands. The show will be aired Tuesday this coming week and will be available as a podcast at their website. Exciting stuff!
All in all Finland was a wonderful experience and we hope to come back sooner rather than later!
Another big thing that we’re tremendously excited to share with you all is that we finished a five track EP that will be released in a month time! The EP is called Running With Insanity EP and will be released in Denmark on February 21st and in The States on March 29th.
For those of you who are ready for a tiny sample you can get a jump on the title song at SoundCloud right here.

We look forward to present to you the whole EP and hope you’ll dig it!
Until then – take care,
Gustav, Anders, Thorben, Sune, Morten &amp; Kristine
PS. As one last thing we’re very proud to find that Lou Reed mentions us and “Closer to Dallas” (from Let This Be The Last Night We Care, red.) on his latest New York Shuffle Playlist. Outrageous thought that mister Reed is strolling around humming along to the whispering choir arrangements. We’re proud…</description><pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
