{"discography_albums":[{"id":"229","title":"Alcoholic Faith Mission Bio","information":"","details":"The idea of the experimentally playful indifolk-collective, Alcoholic Faith Mission, started on a cold winter's morning in Brooklyn, New York '06.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two highschool friends, Sune and Thorben, were discussing drunken family members, when they suddenly stood in front the church Apostolic Faith Mission's neon sign.\r\n\r\nIf you were to change Apostolic into Alcoholic, they thought to themselves, then you'd have a pretty cool name for a band.\r\n\r\nAlcoholic being religion to the Alcoholic. A way thru an empty existence.\r\nSix months later the duo released their debut.\r\n\r\nToday AFM is a sixtet with three albums, lots of critical acclaim from all over the world and and array shows and festivals behind them.\r\nThe connection with New York has more than once brought the band back and in October 2010 they played the city's CMJ festival and was highlighted by much American media as one of the \"must-see\" acts between 1200 other bands.\r\n\r\nTheir latest effort, LET THIS BE THE LAST NIGHT WE CARE has also been featured on many international \"best of 2010 list's\".\r\n\r\nThis coming year AFM will present to more releases and as of now there's planned festival's at Canadian Music Week (CA), SXSW (US), Siesta (SE), Positivus (LV) among others.","cover_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5348\/images\/discography_images\/229.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5348\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/229.jpg"},"flyer_image":{"uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5348\/images\/discography_images\/229.jpg","thumb_uri":"http:\/\/phizuu.com\/static_files\/5348\/images\/discography_thumb_images\/229.jpg"},"buy_urls":[{"title":"iTunes","uri":"http:\/\/ax.search.itunes.apple.com\/WebObjects\/MZSearch.woa\/wa\/search?media=music&restrict=true&submit=media&term=alcoholic+faith+mission"}],"like_count":"0"}]}
