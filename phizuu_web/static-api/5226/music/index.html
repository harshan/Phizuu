Zee, the technical brain of the trio, stems from the world of drivers, patches, workarounds, software and glitches. His religiosity to details gives us the fresh, crisp and warm Brazilian flavors that embodies each of their productions. \n\nSince formalizing their relationship as a group, they have released original gems on Conya Records and Symple Soul. Delicious deserts in the form of remixes are audio delicacies on labels such as Soundmen On Wax, Abicah Soul and Seed, just to name a few. \n\nCreative soul-centred music is the forward-looking path this trio now travels a path that leads to the centre stage of the world's heart.\n\n\nhttp:\/\/www.kularecords.com\nhttp:\/\/www.fresh27.co.uk\nhttp:\/\/www.myspace.com\/braziliansoulcrew","image":{"uri":""},"category_id":"0"},{"flags":12,"id":"961","title":"No Giving Up (Incl.
