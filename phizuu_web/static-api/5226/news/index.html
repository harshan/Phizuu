Fresh 27 - Still Believe (Brazilian Soul Crew Remixes)

Fresh 27's recent club hit &quot;Still believe&quot; gets the remix treatment by the Brazilian Soul Crew who take the track to the next level with their fresh interpretation. The heartfelt vocals by Alex Sun Drae are accompanied by marvelous jazzy keys, underpinned with a fierce yet soulful funk soaked groove - the result is exhilarating and soulful yet resistless.
